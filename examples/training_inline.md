# 1.1 Reasons for project management and success criteria

**Why is project management important?**

- Organizations are subjected to constant change
- Many tasks are complex and new ðŸ¡ª often many specialists (from different departments) are needed to accomplish the work
- When working on projects, often experts from different departments collaborate as a team
- Provides clarity about the tasks / provides structure for projects
- Helps to plan and control quality, cost and time

**What are the benefits of project management?**

- Initially, project management requires increased planning effort (when launching a project)
- During the lifetime of the project it provides many benefits:
- Early detection of changes compared to the project schedule
- Lower overall project cost
- Achieving the projectâ€˜s objectives
- Better collaboration and communication among project collaborators
- Less time required during the project life time, scheduled dates are reached

# 1.2 What is a project?

Characteristics of a project:

1. Clear objective
2. Novelty
3. Unique
4. Complex
5. Time restriction

# 1.4 Phases of traditional project management

Four main project management phases:

1. **Phase 1: Definition**
   1. Define project objectives and requirements (SMART = Specific, Measurable, Accepted, Realistic, Timely)
      - Project justification, benefit, objective, end results, success criteria, project phases / milestones
   2. Possibly specification sheet (for complex projects)
      - Project risks, efficiency, budget, specification & guidelines, technical drawings
   3. Draft planning
      - Project assignment
2. **Phase 2: Planning**
   1. Create project plans
   2. Work breakdown structure
   3. Schedule
   4. Resource planning
   5. Cost planning
3. **Phase 3: Project execution and controlling**
   1. Project execution and communication
   2. Controlling (dates, costs, quality)
   3. Project control
   4. Project documentation
4. **Phase 4: Project close**
   1. Evaluation / project close

```

# 4.1.1 Versions as prerequisites for backlogs (1/2)

Versions are the basis for using Backlogs (and the Roadmap view). You can create and manage them from the project settings.

---
```yml
slideType: title-image
image: images/image_75.png
```

# 4.1.2 Versions as prerequisites for backlogs (2/2)

When creating a version, the following attributes are important: Status, start and finish date, column in backlog (left, right, none).

---
```yml
slideType: title-image
image: images/image_76.png
```

# 4.1.3 Product Backlog and Sprint Backlog (1/2)

Sprints are displayed on the left side of the backlogs page, product backlogs on the right. Sprints have more capabilites than product backlogs.

---
```yml
slideType: title-image
image: images/image_77.png
```

# 4.1.4 Product Backlog and Sprint Backlog (2/2)

Sprint Backlogs allow you to access a task board, a burndown chart or sprint wiki (which is not possible for a product backlog).

---
```yml
slideType: title-image
image: images/image_78.png
```

# 4.1.5 Product Backlog

Before starting a sprint, features and bugs are collected in product backlog. You can then estimate work packages in story points.

---
```yml
slideType: title-image
image: images/image_79.png
```

# 4.1.6 Sprints

After estimating user stories and bugs you can assign them to the sprint backlog. Use the sprint velocity to plan your sprint.

---
```yml
slideType: title-image
image: images/image_80.png
```

# 4.1.7 Taskboard (1/2)

When all user stories and bugs are assigned to a sprint, they can be broken down into individual tasks which are managed on the task board.

---
```yml
slideType: title-image
image: images/image_81.png
```

# 4.1.7 Taskboard (2/2)

Aside from tasks, you can keep track of sprint impediments on the task board. Impediments can block user stories / bugs.

---
```yml
slideType: title-image
image: images/image_82.png
```

# 4.1.8 Definition of Done

You can select the Definition of Done from the project settings to define when a user story or bug counts as completed.

---
```yml
slideType: title-image
image: images/image_83.png
```

# 4.1.9 Update version after completing the sprint

After completing a sprint, the open user stories / bugs are moved into the next sprint. The sprint is then closed.

---
```yml
slideType: title-image
image: images/image_84.png
```

# 4.1.10 Account-specific settings (â€žMy accountâ€œ)

To get a better overview, each user can define the task color for their own account and can configure if backlogs versions are displayed folded.

---
```yml
slideType: title-image
image: images/image_85.png
```

# 4.1.11 Configure backlog plugins (administration)

You can define which types are shown in the backlog by navigating to the administration and selecting the backlogs plugin.

---
```yml
slideType: title-image
image: images/image_86.png
```

# 4.1.12 Configure backlog plugins (administration)

The backlog configuration works across all projects. The story type as well as the task type can be configured.

---
```yml

```

Part 4.2

Agile project management

Kanban Boards

---
```yml
slideType: title-image
image: images/image_88.png
```

# 4.2.1 Activate boards

(Kanban) boards can be activated in the project settings. After activating the boards module, boards are accessible from the side menu.

---
```yml
slideType: title-image
image: images/image_89.png
```

# 4.2.2 Create boards

You can create two different kinds of boars: Basic boards allow you to enter your own column names. Action boards display either the work package status or version name.

---
```yml
slideType: title-image
image: images/image_90.png
```

# 4.2.3 Basic Board

When creating a basic board, you can freely select the column names (e.g. department name). When moving work packages between columns, work packages are not changed.

---
```yml
slideType: title-image
image: images/image_91.png

```

# 4.2.4 Action Board

When creating an Action Board, you can select to either display the work package status or versions as columns. When a work package is moved (e.g. from status â€žNewâ€œ to â€žIn progressâ€œ) its status is updated accordingly.

---
```yml
slideType: title-image
image: images/image_92.png
```
